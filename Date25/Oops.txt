OOps concepts:
1)Class -->imaginary part
2)Object -->obj always map to real time entity,name must be meaningful
    eg.Student s1=new Student(1,'df',89);
    -->Student is a type of s1 (data type)
    ->new creates a memory for constructor , has starting address,stored in referenvce variable
    -->what is use of memory? to store data then to accsess
3)constructor
    -->by default jvm creates the constructor
    -->cannot be static and final;
    -->only be public,private(),protected
            -->private error be:error: constructor A in class A cannot be applied to given types;B(Integer num1){
            -->if i give default constructor error will gone
    -->when i have super keyword it create obj for A and then for B
    -->super() is seen 1st inside the constructor
4)abstraction
5)encapsulation
6)inheritance
    -->a class has its own properties also has extended properties
7)polymorphism
    -->many forms
8)association
9)aggregation
10)composition
