1).Static keyword
    -->used to accsess main without object (ie : without memory);
    -->without creating object static will work
    -->long term memory (areated inside class area in jvm before creating object)
    -->used by any function
Where static can be used:
    a).variable
    b).methods
        -->without creating object we can access methods with ststic keyword
        -->when we call static variable inside static and non static method menans no error or problem
        -->a non static variable cannot be accessed inside static function
    c).class
    d).block {//inisde these are block}
        -->used to open connection****
        -->always exected 1st
        -->used when we need connection before running



Extend keyword:-->a variable get value from another function,get initialised by value from anthor variable
register:has reference of all operation which are to be done in another memory
cache/buffer:store frquently used object , to access application faster
stack:main memory is created inside this stack , for all methods memory is created,all process takes plac
heap:long term memory , to create memory use "static" keyword,new keyword



2)Final keyword
    -->used to close connection
    -->act as constant keyword
-->used before:
    a)class
        -->all wrapper class are final class
        -->once class is declared as finally it cannot be extended
        -->a class cannot be abstract and finall (connot go along)
    b)method
        -->cannot be overrided
    c)variable
        -->if variable is created with finall keyword it cannot be reinitialized
        example:    
            class welcome{
                finall Integer num1=10;
                public void method(){
                    num1=80;//errror because cannot be reinitialized
                }
            }
